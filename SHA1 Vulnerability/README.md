# SHA1 deprecated setting for SSH

## QID-38909
This repository contains a script that detects and mitigates vulnerabilities in SSH configurations by removing the use of weak SHA1-based MAC (Message Authentication Code) algorithms. If vulnerable algorithms are detected, the script removes vulnerability and restarts the SSH service to apply the changes.

## Features

- Detects the use of SHA1-based MAC algorithms in SSH configuration.
- Backs up the existing SSH configuration file (`sshd_config`).
- Restarts the SSH service to apply the changes.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure the script has execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x patch_ssh_vuln.sh
