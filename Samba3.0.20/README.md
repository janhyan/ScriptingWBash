# Samba Configuration Editor Script

This script searches for the Samba configuration file (`/etc/samba/smb.conf`), creates a backup of the file, and then comments out any occurrence of the `username` directive within the configuration.

## Usage

1. Clone or copy the script to your machine.
2. Ensure the script has execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x edit_samba.sh
3. Execute the script:
    ```bash
    sudo ./samba3.0.20-patch.sh

## Notes
A backup of the original configuration file is saved as /etc/samba/smb.conf.bak before making changes.
